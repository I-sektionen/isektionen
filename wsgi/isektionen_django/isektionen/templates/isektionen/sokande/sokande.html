                    I don't think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. mister wayne, if you don't want
                    to tell me exactly what you're doing, when i'm asked, i don't have to lie. but don't think of me as
                    an idiot. boxing is about respect. getting it for yourself, and taking it away from the other guy.
                    circumstances have taught me that a man's ethics are the only possessions he will take beyond the
                    grave. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. multiply your anger by about a
                    hundred, kate, that's how much he thinks he loves you. you want a guarantee, buy a toaster. when
                    a naked man's chasing a woman through an alley with a butcher knife and a hard-on, i figure he's
                    not out collecting for the red cross. the man likes to play chess; let's get him some rocks. you
                    want a guarantee, buy a toaster. it only took me six days. same time it took the lord to make the
                    world. well, what is it today? more spelunking?
                    This is my gun, clyde! i now issue a new commandment: thou shalt do the dance. man's gotta know his limitations.
                    bruce... i'm god. it only took me six days. same time it took the lord to make the world. what you
                    have to ask yourself is, do i feel lucky. well do ya' punk? when a naked man's chasing a woman
                    through an alley with a butcher knife and a hard-on, i figure he's not out collecting for the red
                    cross. you measure yourself by the people who measure themselves by you. well, do you have
                    anything to say for yourself? bruce... i'm god. are you feeling lucky punk dyin' ain't much of
                    a livin', boy.
